# TentacleOS

This repo contains all the packages necessary to run each element of our T1 robot on ROS.

* Packages for the arm, IMU sensors, vision system, and mind.
* Dockerfiles for RaspberryPi (arm and IMU sensors) and Desktop (vision system)
* Docker-compose, for quickly running ROS commands during dev if ROS isn't set up on local OS.
